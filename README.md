# STUDYplan
## Abstract
*STUDYplan* came about as a university project at the [KIT Department of Informatics](http://www.informatik.kit.edu/english/index.php) (*Praxis der Softwareentwicklung* at IPD BÃ¶hm).
This system serves as a tool for creating, verifying or procedurally generating a student's studyplan.
The software system has two parts:
- A REST Web service implementing the managment of users and studyplans as well as the verification and generation of studyplans
- A Webapp client allowing users to access all functionalities of said REST Web service.
